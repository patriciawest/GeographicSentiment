# Geographic Sentiment Analysis of Reddit Data
This dashboard is created in support of the Applied Data Science coursework. It displays the sentiment distribution of comments within the `r/Europe' community on the social media platform *Reddit*, with specific emphasis on how sentiment varies based on the author's national identity. A dataset containing over 65,000 comments is produced, which is then analyzed under different sentiment models. Metrics are gathered for the undirected (posted from a country) and directed (posted toward a country) sentiment for these comments. Topic Modelling and Named Entity Recognition are carried out to allow visualisation of sentiment based on specific topics or towards entities.
